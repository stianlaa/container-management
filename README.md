# container-management
An experimental repo to test out management approaches of docker containers 

## Aspects to investigate:

- creation of docker images
- feeding docker images with arguments, updating arguments
- providing images with dependencies
- sharing of docker images with tags
- docker registry, and consequence of image size. (alpine is around 700MB)
- api to manage services (e.g for management from web)
