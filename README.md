# container-management
An experimental repo to test out management approaches of docker containers 

## Installation:
See: https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

## Basic use:

Build images: `docker compose build arg-poc`
Run specific image: `docker compose up arg-poc`
Run all images: `docker compose up`

### Integration with github actions
- if branch is tagged to match regex: `image_v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+`, start deploy image pipeline, regarding tag naming, see conventions: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/tag/
So to tag and create images from ci, use:
```
    git tag -a image_v0.0.1 -m "example tag to trigger build"
    git push origin <tag_name>
```

### Pulling generated images with specific version from repository
Given that they have been generated by the ci, as specified by tag above it should be possible to pull images by:
```
NU_VER=0.0.1 docker compose pull
```

Regarding image size etc., docker is excellent at layered pulls, that means it will reuse most of the parts of the images pulled. So at the initial pull alpine is around 700MB for one image, after that it's much smaller.

### Pushing a local repository to docker registry manually
```
    docker login --username username
    docker tag my-image username/my-repo
    docker push username/my-repo
```

### Pushing a specific image to docker registry manually
```
    docker build -t appname -f dockerfilepath/Dockerfile .
    docker login --username username
    docker tag appname username/registryname:tagname
    docker push username/registryname:tagname
```

### Pulling a specific tag from docker registry
``` 
    docker login --username username
    docker pull stianlaa/dev-docker-repo:first-tag
```

### Authentication
There might be an alternative to do docker login upon setup. Docker login creates or updates the ~/.docker/config.json file for you.

### Management api
- api to manage services (e.g. for management from web)
- maybe there are node modules which provide the integration out-of-the-box
Node packages to interact with docker:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/dockerode
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-docker-api

### Removing unknown containers, (permission issue)
Removing unknown containers
```
sudo aa-remove-unknown
docker container kill $(docker ps -q)
```

### Stopping running rust apps
```
Rust doesn't automatically handle sigterm signal, docker by default emits sigkill which works after 10 seconds
To emit sigkill with a shorter delay, --time option can be used
docker stop <container> --time=1
```

### Regarding manager implementation
It seems that docker daemon communications ideally over socket, and a webserver should exist to map and forward http requests, much the same way a systemd setup might have to.
It is possible to expose the docker daemon, but not recommended, and this would entail extra work in frontend: https://towardsaws.com/ec2-2-ways-to-expose-docker-daemon-to-the-internet-why-61e349f99744

### Remaining to explore:
- explore nginx setup with manager-web
- explore placing manager-api inside a container
- explore protecting some containers from being stopped from frontend
- fix buttons on containerpage
- implement argument editing, see how this persists across reboots
- Pull out activate inProgress to wrapper function, e.g modify argument object which has inProgress member
- Consider adding ContainerIdentifier class, where containerName if needed can be translated to id etc
- make example app which uses camera
- make example app testing logging capability
- make example apps which interact over network

---
### docker-compose plan: endpoints, naming and structure:
structure:
- what is running is containers, and should be named so, to distinguish them from systemd services
- instead of integrating directly with docker-compose, introduce endpoint for list of containers, this allows for docker changes in the future without adapting frontend
- similarly, keep mapping layer between docker-api and docker endpoint
